#StudIP File Downloader

This script was written for Python 2.7.11 and is compatible with Windows, Mac OS X and Linux
It requires the several modules, which will be automatically installed, if the script is started with administrator-privileges
The purpose of this script is to check for new files on the StudIP-website of the university of Passau, 
which are then downloaded and saved in your desired destination folder
